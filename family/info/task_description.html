    <p>
        Michael always knew that there was something wrong with his family. Many strangers were introduced to him as part of his family.
    </p>

    <p>
        Michael should figure this out. He spent almost a month parsing family archives. He has all father-son connections of his entire family collected in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all that data Michel can easily understand who the strangers are. Or maybe the only stranger in this family is Michael? Let’ see.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
